Project Description  
The Coding Lab Management System is a web-based platform designed to streamline programming education by providing an integrated environment for managing coding labs and assignments. Teachers can create and distribute assignments, while students can write, compile, and submit their code directly through an online code editor powered by the Paiza.IO API. The system supports multiple programming languages, real-time compilation, and submission tracking, enabling teachers to review student submissions, assign scores, and provide feedback efficiently. Built using Django, this project aims to enhance the learning experience for students and simplify the evaluation process for educators in a collaborative and user-friendly manner.
