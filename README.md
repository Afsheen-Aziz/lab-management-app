Project Description
The Coding Lab Management System is an innovative web platform designed to revolutionize coding education.
Managing coding labs in educational institutions is inefficient due to the lack of a centralized system for assigning coding problems, compiling and submitting code, tracking student progress and tracking of student progress by the educators.
We developed a Coding Lab Management System to streamline lab-based programming education by enabling teachers to create and manage assignments, students to write and submit code with real-time compilation, and providing a centralized platform for both teacher and student convenience.
